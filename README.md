# Java-Codes-ICSE
These are some of the miscellaneous Java programs during my 9th and 10th standard (ICSE).
These are mostly basic programs to understand the implementation of arrays, matrices, strings and some easy algorithms.
Some of the programs include pattern printing, searching, sorting and other beginner level problems you might find in books or on the internet
The codes are easy to understand and well indented
